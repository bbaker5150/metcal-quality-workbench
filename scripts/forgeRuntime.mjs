// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Do Forge's ship step at build time.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Forge is a scaffolding tool for people building apps without a repository.
// Its "ship" step is not a security control and does not sign anything — it
// inlines two runtime scripts and prepends a manifest comment. Reproducing that
// in the build is what lets a push to `main` produce a finished, deployable
// file with no workstation in the loop.
//
// The host page renders the "Not Secured" banner by looking for the globals
// those scripts install, which is why including them settles it. See
// vendor/forge/README.md for the provenance of the vendored bytes.
//
// Ordering matters twice over:
//
//   - devconsole patches `console` and `fetch`, so it goes at the top of
//     <head>, ahead of the app bundle. testRecorder goes before </body>.
//   - This plugin runs after hardenInlineHtml has finished with the app
//     bundle, and hardens the vendored runtime itself on the way in. Forge
//     inlines those bytes raw and ships a broken regex because of it — see
//     inlineScript below.

 * tokeniser rewrites a raw NUL inside a `<script>` to U+FFFD, so every Forge
 * app throws "Range out of order in character class" on load.
 *

 * fixes that: it only rewrites inside string, template, and regex literals, and
 * it re-reads the result to prove every literal still carries the same value.
